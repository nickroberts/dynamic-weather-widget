# Übersicht Weather Widget

This is a weather widget based on the weather widget from https://github.com/felixhageloh/weather-widget

This also can be dynamic, based on your location (via your current ip address).

## Setup

### Location

You can do one of 2 things:
1. Enter your latitude and longitude, along with your city and region code (state), making sure the dynamic section is commented out.
2. Uncomment the section for the dynamic location, making sure the section where you enter your latitude, longitude, city and region_code.
